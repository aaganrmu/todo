# Simple CLI TODO tool
A custom todo list with dependencies and priorities. I'm building this because I'm easily distracted. 
## Must haves
- Lives in CLI
- Reads lists from YML files
- Allows you to complete items
- New items pop up once dependencies are done
- Only show a few items at a timed
- Quick to use, not easy
## Nice to haves
- Configuration for amount of tasks to show
- List editor
- Navigation through list
- Two modes:
    - autosaving (useful for bigger projects)
    - non-saving (useful for repeated tasks)
- Colours
- Validation
## Commands
#### import FILE
Starts working on this todo list
#### show
Shows current tasks that can be worked on
#### start TASK
Starts working on a task
#### complete TASK
Completes a task
